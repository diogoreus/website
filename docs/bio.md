## Leadership Philosophy

**From LinkedIn About:**
> "I love building products but hate selling myself. So here are six quick facts about me and my work:
> 1) I transformed a startup into a market leader, scaling from zero to millions in recurring revenue. Built products used by brands you know well - Tok&Stok, Banco do Brasil, VW, Embraer.
> 2) I'm a 3-in-1 professional: Designer by education, developer by passion, and executive by challenge.
> 3) My journey is a bit different. Started as a frontend developer, became tech lead, then head of product, CPO, and finally CGO. In each role, I kept my hands in the code (or at least close to it). I believe the best leaders deeply understand what they're building."

**On Leadership:**
> "I believe products are made for people by people, so I prioritize collaboration and humanized leadership, promoting autonomy and motivation in teams."

**On Building:**
> "Even after more than a decade in the market, I still get excited like a beginner when I solve a complex product problem or see a user having an amazing experience with something I helped create."
